# GA4 bonus marks

### Post 1 (ID: 607882)

Sir,  
I haven’t received bonus marks in ga4 as, i posted queries in discourse
regarding ga4. I have scored 8 marks in ga4, but after bonus marks it should
be 9, but in dashboard it is showing only 80 marks.  
Kindly, update my marks in dashboard.

Hi [@Sakshi6479](/u/sakshi6479),

We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction.

That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4.

Kind regards
