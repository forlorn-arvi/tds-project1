[@carlton](/u/carlton) will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, I could only find one live session of ROE in
youtube. Can you please point out where are the other recordings?

### Post 11 (ID: 601950)

All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a
special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving
component. These are all available on the Youtube channel

I hope the Remote Online Exam (ROE) is ready to be uploaded to the portal. Is
