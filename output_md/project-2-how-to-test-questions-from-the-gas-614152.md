# Project 2: How to test questions from the GA's

### Post 1 (ID: 613779)

Hello everyone,

I have completed a working project of P2, but I want to test it out with
actual questions from the GA’s. Is there anyone that can provide with sample
question structure, or 1 or 2 questions as a form of ‘test cases’ so that we
can try and fix our project?

Thank you very much in advance  
Aryan Singh

You can do a curl post request or use something like Thunderclient or Postman.
If you used fastapi then in the /docs path of your link you will find the open
API user interface which you can also use for testing.
