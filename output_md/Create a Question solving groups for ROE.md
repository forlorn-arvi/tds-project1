# Create a Question solving groups for ROE

### Post 1 (ID: 600396)

Whoever wants can participate and then we go into breakout rooms and each
group solves a particular question and then we all share the code so we can
complete the ROE faster and more effienctly?

Are we allowed to do that?

### Post 3 (ID: 600398)

Yeah they said you can take help anyway possible even to ask a cat also or a
pet, im not sure


---

### Post 4 (ID: 600399)

Alright, works. I am down to collaborate.

### Post 5 (ID: 600400)

Asking help is different from sharing answers in a public forum. I don’t think
they will permit this.


---

### Post 6 (ID: 600401)

Sharing answers is asking for help

### Post 7 (ID: 600402)

If the ROE is like how it was for MOCK ROE1 then this probably wont work
right?  
Only for today’s ROE(mock 2) we can split the tasks efficiently and get it
done.  
Thoughts?

Their whole concept of implicit learning disappears when people start sharing
answers in a public forum.
