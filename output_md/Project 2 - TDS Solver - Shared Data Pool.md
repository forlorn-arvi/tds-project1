# Project 2 - TDS Solver - Discussion Thread

### Creating this Thread to share answers and questions from your respective
assignments

### Why? ![:interrobang:](https://emoji.discourse-
cdn.com/google/interrobang.png?v=12)![:thinking:](https://emoji.discourse-
cdn.com/google/thinking.png?v=12)

If we can Train the LLM with these Questions already, we can easily do well?

### Too many Questions for LLM ![:nerd_face:](https://emoji.discourse-
cdn.com/google/nerd_face.png?v=12)![:nerd_face:](https://emoji.discourse-
cdn.com/google/nerd_face.png?v=12)![:nerd_face:](https://emoji.discourse-

True we can use embeddings, map that stored in-system dictionary and use
relevant questions from in-system data to send as context with answer

### What We need from YOU 🫵🏽

Get to scraping your respective Graded Assignments and post the it?

### How?

  * If answers are saved, Just Print (Ctrl+P) and save pdf, not really if this would work
  * If you had saved code for each question, send the saved code and with a docstring as the question , This would be useful ![:+1:t3:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/+1/3.png?v=12)![:+1:t3:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/+1/3.png?v=12)

    # TDS-Project2-QuestionBank
    Question Bank for all TDS assignments
    
    # Requested format
    ## Student Assignments Directory Structure
    
    Each student has a folder named with their roll number. Inside each student's folder, there are multiple assignment folders (`Assignment_X`). Each assignment contains:
    - A `.txt` file with the question statement.
    - A corresponding `.py`, `.sh`, or `.js` file for the solution.
    
    ### Example Directory Structure
    RollNo_12345/
    ├── Assignment_1/
    │   ├── Q1.txt    # Question for Q1
    │   ├── Q1.py     # Solution in Python
    │   ├── Q2.txt    # Question for Q2
    │   ├── Q2.sh     # Solution in Bash
    │   ├── Q3.txt    # Question for Q3
    │   ├── Q3.js     # Solution in JavaScript
    ├── Assignment_2/
