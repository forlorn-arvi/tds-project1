Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns
include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series
ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could
someone please assist me with this?

In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are  
![{7059D6FF-DF75-4B21-999A-29D23A297A90}](https://europe1.discourse-
cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/6/a6fdec02b5239ef02c5198e250c8a2d6eb007b82.png)

but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”  
![{F9711583-E074-489A-AC90-154B9309F786}](https://europe1.discourse-

Below items don’t have prices.

PCU3254123254127111 | Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations  
---|---  
PCU3254123254127114 | Calcium channel blockers  
PCU325412325412MM | Miscellaneous receipts  
PCU325412325412D112OC | Other digestive or genito-urinary preparations, over-the-counter  
PCU325412325412D113 | Antacids  
PCU325412325412SS | Secondary products  
PCU3254123254127112 | ACE inhibitors  
  
Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.  
Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024
December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

Shall I delete the records for which price is not available?

Hi Tanya,

Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just
the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses.

Kind regards
