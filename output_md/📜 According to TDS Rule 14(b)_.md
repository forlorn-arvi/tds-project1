**“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing
assignments.”**  
So I did. ![:man_tipping_hand:](https://emoji.discourse-

Assignments_ ![:books:](https://emoji.discourse-

Yes, I got **great marks** in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.  
But let’s be real…

It was **my Labrador** who did the actual work

While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:

  * Solving **deployment issues** faster than my dev server boots
  * Writing **function calling code** like a true GPT whisperer
  * Fixing **LLM bugs** that I didn’t even understand

Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.  
He growled at broken APIs.  
I took the credit. ![:nail_polish:](https://emoji.discourse-

Let your pets help with your coursework.  
You get the grade. They get the rage.

After fighting so much for GA, ROE, Project 1, and Project 2, my inner animal
got hurt and fell asleep — and that’s how I ended up missing GA7. Please don’t
hurt him any further.
